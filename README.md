As a Computer Vision enthusiast, I decided to challenge myself. From now on, I will share my journey to learn OpenCV for 15 days. I planned to add daily python files and sources. You can check if I fail or if I become the OpenCV master. 👩🏻‍💻

📌 25.02.2023 - cv0.py: I used imread, imwrite and imshow(additionaly gray option) functions. I showed size, datatype, shape of image and difference between gray and original image. I also split image for blue, green and red. Finally I did some practice about pixels. 🥳<br><br>
📌 26.02.2023 - cv1.py: I captured the dog video,showed original version and additionally resized version.<br><br>
cv1.1.py: I worked on color effects for image and specific part of image.<br><br>
cv1.2.py: I worked on some basic OpenCV functions. I study converting image to grayscale, blurring, edge cascade, edge cascade for a blurry image,dilating, eroding, resizing and finally cropping. 🥳<br><br>
